## General Idea

Focus on Message Spec/IEPD Development as the framework or backbone, bringing in NIEM concepts as part of that process as needed, particularly in the mapping phase.

This is a large change from past training programs, which treated the technical aspects of NIEM as essentially a separate topic from the IEPD-creation process.

Use an actual example Message Spec as the framework for the whole thing. Tentatively starting with [Crash Driver IEPD](https://github.com/iamdrscott/CrashDriver) from [[Dr. Scott]].

### Potential IEPDs to Use

- Requirements:
	- Needs to cover _all_ technical features of NIEM
	- General purpose, understandable to all
		- Uses domains
		- But not overly specific to one
	- Real world scenario, but not required to be a "real" IEPD
		- Actual in-use IEPD may be problematic because we'll change it for the training
	- Covers the big three objects:
		- People
		- Locations
		- Activities
	- Small enough to understand in class
- Possibilities:
	- Crash Driver IEPD from [[Dr. Scott]]
		- Covers nearly all NIEM features, by design
			- Ensure external standards work
			- Improve augmentations
			- Replace "fictional" indicator
		- Justice-specific, but not objectionably so
		- Juvenile aspect so as to bring in HS? Learners permit?
	- Amber Alert
		- Currently NIEM 3? [Amber Alert sample message from Nlets](https://wiki.nlets.org/index.php/Section_34:_Amber_Alert#Amber_Alert_NIEM_Examples).
		- Justice-specific
		- Doesn't use referencing and some more esoteric features
	- Severe weather
		- Good general purpose concept
			- We're not experts on the real-world content, though
		- Could utilizes EM domain
		- Not much in NIEM for this
	- SBA loans for COVID
		- Not general knowledge
		- Short-term interest
	- Insurance Claim IEPD from [[Webb Roberts]]?
		- Could not find this anywhere
	- Superhero IEPD
		- Not real-world
