## Introduction to NIEM

### What is NIEM? - Framework
- NIEM is a community-driven, government and jurisdiction-wide, standards-based approach to exchanging information
- Diverse communities can collectively leverage NIEM to increase efficiencies and improve decision-making
- NIEM is available to everyone, including public and private organizations
- NIEM includes a data model, governance, training, tools, technical support services, and an active community to assist users in adopting a standards-based approach to exchanging data

### What is NIEM? – Interop Problem
- If we don’t understand what each other means, we won’t be able to exchange info
- Need a common language for defining things

### What is NIEM? And what not?
**NIEM is:**
- a common vocabulary
- a means of enabling efficient information exchange across diverse public and private - organizations

**NIEM is not:**
- a system or database
- a means of specifying how to transmit or store data
___
### What is NIEM? – Exchanging Data and Components
- Using NIEM, organizations come together to agree on a common vocabulary
- When additional organizations are added to the information exchange, the initial NIEM exchange can be reused, saving time and money
